Docs overview This documentation provides an overview over JUDI's basic data structures and abstract operators: Tutorials : Shows basic functionalities and some common applications. Data structures : Explains the Model , Geometry and Info data structures and how to set up acquisition geometries. Abstract vectors : Documents JUDI's abstract vector classes judiVector , judiWavefield , judiRHS , judiWeights and judiExtendedSource . Abstract operators : Lists and explains JUDI's abstract linear operators judiModeling , judiJacobian , judiProjection and judiLRWF . Input/Output : Read SEG-Y data and set up judiVectors for shot records and sources. Read velocity models. Helper functions : API of functions that make your life easier. Preconditioners : Basic preconditioners for seismic imaging. Installation First, install Devito using pip , or see the Devito's GitHub page for installation with Conda and further information. The current release of JUDI requires Python 3 and the current Devito version. Run all of the following commands from the (bash) terminal command line (not in the Julia REPL): pip3 install --user git+https://github.com/devitocodes/devito.git For reading and writing seismic SEG-Y data, JUDI uses the SegyIO package and matrix-free linear operators are based the Julia Operator LIbrary (JOLI): julia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.develop(PackageSpec(url=\"https://github.com/slimgroup/SegyIO.jl\"))' julia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.develop(PackageSpec(url=\"https://github.com/slimgroup/JOLI.jl\"))' Once Devito, SegyIO and JOLI are installed, you can install JUDI as follows: julia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.develop(PackageSpec(url=\"https://github.com/slimgroup/JUDI.jl\"))' Once you have JUDI installed, you need to point Julia's PyCall package to the Python version for which we previsouly installed Devito. To do this, copy-paste the following commands into the (bash) terminal: export PYTHON=$(which python3) julia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.build(\"PyCall\")' Running with Docker If you do not want to install JUDI, you can run JUDI as a docker image. The first possibility is to run the docker container as a Jupyter notebook: docker run -p 8888:8888 philippwitte/judi:v1.3 This command downloads the image and launches a container. You will see a link that you can copy-past to your browser to access the notebooks. Alternatively, you can run a bash session, in which you can start a regular interactive Julia session and run the example scripts. Download/start the container as a bash session with: docker run -it philippwitte/judi:v1.3 /bin/bash Inside the container, all examples are located in the directory /app/judi/examples/scripts . Configure compiler and OpenMP Devito uses just-in-time compilation for the underlying wave equation solves. The default compiler is intel, but can be changed to any other specified compiler such as gnu . Either run the following command from the command line or add it to your ~/.bashrc file: export DEVITO_ARCH=gnu Devito uses shared memory OpenMP parallelism for solving PDEs. OpenMP is disabled by default, but you can enable OpenMP and define the number of threads (per PDE solve) as follows: export DEVITO_LANGUAGE=openmp # Enable OpenMP. export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 # Number of OpenMP threads Troubleshooting For troubleshooting please raise an issue on the JUDI github page or contact Philipp Witte at pwitte3@gatech.edu or Mathias Louboutin at mlouboutin3@gatech.edu","title":"Home"},{"location":"#the-julia-devito-inversion-framework-judijl","text":"JUDI is a framework for large-scale seismic modeling and inversion and designed to enable rapid translations of algorithms to fast and efficient code that scales to industry-size 3D problems.

Data interpolation Time interpolation for source/receiver data using splines.

JUDI supports reading SEG-Y from disk into memory, as well as working with out-of-core (OOC) data containers. In the latter case, judiVectors contain look-up tables that allow accessing the underlying data in constant time. Reading SEG-Y files into memory To read a single SEG-Y file into memory, use the segy_read function: using SegyIO block = segy_read(\"data.segy\") From a SegyIO data block, you can create an in-core judiVector , as well as a Geometry object for the source: # judiVector for observed data d_obs = judiVector(block; segy_depth_key=\"RecGroupElevation\") # Source geometry src_geometry = Geometry(block; key=\"source\", segy_depth_key=\"SourceDepth\") The optional keyword segy_depth_key specifies which SEG-Y header stores the depth coordinate. After reading a block , you can check block.traceheaders to see which trace headers are set and where to find the depth coordinates for sources or receivers. The d_obs vector constains the receiver geometry in d_obs.geometry , so there is no need to set up a separate geometry object manually. However, in principle we can set up a receiver Geometry object as follows: rec_geometry = Geometry(block; key=\"receiver\", segy_depth_key=\"RecGroupElevation\") Writing SEG-Y files To write a judiVector as a SEG-Y file, we need a judiVector containing the receiver data and geometry, as well as a judiVector with the source coordinates. From the judiVectors , we first create a SegyIO block: block = judiVector_to_SeisBlock(d_obs, q) where d_obs and q are judiVectors for receiver and source data respectively. Next, we can write a SEG-Y file from a SegyIO block : segy_write(\"new_file.segy\", block) # writes a SEG-Y file called new_file.segy Reading out-of-core SEG-Y files For SEG-Y files that do not fit into memory, JUDI provides the possibility to work with OOC data containers. First, SegyIO scans also available files and then creates a lookup table, including a summary of the most important SEG-Y header values. See SegyIO's documentation for more information. First we provide the path to the directory that we want to scan, as well as a string that appears in all the files we want to scan. For example, here we want to scan all files that contain the string \"bp_observed_data\" . The third argument is a list of SEG-Y headers for which we create a summary. For creating OOC judiVectors , always include the \"GroupX\" , \"GroupY\" and \"dt\" keyworkds, as well as the keywords that carry the source and receiver depth coordinates: # Specify direcotry to scan path_to_data = \"/home/username/data_directory/\" # Scan files in given directory and create OOC data container container = segy_scan(path_to_data, \"bp_observed_data\", [\"GroupX\", \"GroupY\", \"RecGroupElevation\", \"SourceDepth\", \"dt\"]) Depending of the number and size of the underlying files, this process can take multiple hours, but it only has to be executed once! Furthermore, parallel scanning is supported as well. Once we have scanned all files in the directory, we can create an OOC judiVector and source Geometry object as follows: # Create OOC judiVector d_obs = judiVector(container; segy_depth_key=\"RecGroupElevation\") # Create OOC source geometry object src_geometry = Geometry(container; key=\"source\", segy_depth_key=\"SourceDepth\") Reading and writing velocity models JUDI does not require velocity models to be read or saved in any specific format. Any file format that allows reading the velocity model as a two or three-dimensional Julia array will work. In our examples, we often use the JLD or HDF5 packages to read/write velocity models and the corresponing meta data (i.e. grid spacings and origins).

For a list of runnable Julia scripts and reproducable research, please also check out the examples directory on Github. 2D Modeling Quickstart To set up a simple 2D modeling experiment with JUDI with an OBN-type acquisition (receivers everywhere), we start by loading the module and building a two layer model: using JUDI.TimeModeling # Grid n = (120, 100) # (x,z) d = (10., 10.) o = (0., 0.) # Velocity [km/s] v = ones(Float32, n) .* 1.4f0 v[:, 50:end] .= 5f0 # Squared slowness m = (1f0 ./ v).^2 For working with JUDI operators, we need to set up a model structure, which contains the grid information, as well as the slowness. Optionally, we can provide an array of the density in [g/cm^3] (by default a density of 1 is used): # Density (optional) rho = ones(Float32, n) # Model structure: model = Model(n, d, o, m; rho=rho) Next, we define our source acquisition geometry, which needs to be defined as a Geometry structure. The Geometry function requires the x-, y- and z-coordinates of the source locations as input, as well as the modeling time and samping interval of the wavelet. In general, each parameter can be passed as a cell array, where each cell entry provides the information for the respective source location. The helper function convertToCell converts a Julia range to a cell array, which makes defining the source geometry easier: # Set up source geometry nsrc = 4 # no. of sources xsrc = convertToCell(range(400f0, stop=800f0, length=nsrc)) ysrc = convertToCell(range(0f0, stop=0f0, length=nsrc)) zsrc = convertToCell(range(20f0, stop=20f0, length=nsrc)) # Modeling time and sampling interval time = 1000f0 # ms dt = 2f0 # ms # Set up source structure src_geometry = Geometry(xsrc, ysrc, zsrc; dt=dt, t=time) Now we can define our source wavelet. The source must be defined as a judiVector , which takes the source geometry, as well as the source data (i.e. the wavelet) as an input argument: # Source wavelet f0 = 0.01f0 # kHz wavelet = ricker_wavelet(time, dt, f0) q = judiVector(src_geometry, wavelet) In general, wavelet can be a cell array with a different wavelet in each cell, i.e. for every source location. Here, we want to use the same wavelet for all 4 source experiments, so we can simply pass a single vector. As we already specified in our src_geometry object that we want to have 4 source locations, judiVector will automaticallty copy the wavelet for every experiment. Next, we set up the receiver acquisition geometry. Here, we define an OBN acquisition, where the receivers are spread out over the entire domain and each source experiment uses the same set of receivers. Again, we can in principle pass the coordinates as cell arrays, with one cell per source location. Since we want to use the same geometry for every source, we can use a short cut and define the coordinates as Julia ranges and pass nsrc=nsrc as an optional argument to the Geometry function. This tells the function that we want to use our receiver set up for nsrc distinct source experiments: # Set up receiver geometry (for 2D, set yrec to zero) nxrec = 120 xrec = range(50f0, stop=1150f0, length=nxrec) yrec = 0f0 zrec = range(50f0, stop=50f0, length=nxrec) # Set up receiver structure rec_geometry = Geometry(xrec, yrec, zrec; dt=dt, t=time, nsrc=nsrc) With our model and source and receiver geometries in place, we can proceed to defining our linear operator for seismic modeling. First, we need to define an info object, which contains some basic dimensionality information that needs to be shared between operators so that they can determine their size: # Set up info structure for linear operators ntComp = get_computational_nt(src_geometry, rec_geometry, model) info = Info(prod(n), nsrc, ntComp) Next, we can define separate operators for source/receiver projections and a forward modeling operator: # Setup operators Pr = judiProjection(info, rec_geometry) A_inv = judiModeling(info, model) Ps = judiProjection(info, src_geometry) We can see, that from JUDI's perspective, source and receivers are treated equally and are represented by the same operators ( judiProjection ) and vectors ( judiVector ). We also could've skipped setting up the projection operators and directly created: F = judiModeling(info, model, src_geometry, rec_geometry) which is equivalent to creating the combined operator: F = Pr*A_inv*Ps' Finally, to model our seismic data, we run: d_obs = Pr*A_inv*Ps'*q # or d_obs = F*q We can plot a 2D shot record by accessing the .data field of the judiVector , which contains the data in the original (non-vectorized) dimensions: using PyPlot imshow(d_obs.data[1], vmin=-5, vmax=5, cmap=\"seismic\", aspect=\"auto\") We can also set up a Jacobian operator for Born modeling and reverse-time migration. First we set up a (constant) migration velocity model: v0 = ones(Float32, n) .* 1.4f0 m0 = (1f0 ./ v0).^2 dm = m - m0 # model perturbation/image # Model structure model0 = Model(n, d, o, m0) We can create the Jacobian directly from a (non-linear) modeling operator and a source vector: A0_inv = judiModeling(info, model0) # modeling operator for migration velocity J = judiJacobian(Pr*A0_inv*Ps', q) We can use this operator to model single scattered data, as well as for migration our previous data: d_lin = J*vec(dm) # RTM rtm = J'*d_obs To plot, first reshape the image: rtm = reshape(rtm, model0.n) imshow(rtm', cmap=\"gray\", vmin=-1e3, vmax=1e3) 3D Modeling Quickstart Setting up a 3D experiment largely follows the instructions for the 2D example. Instead of a 2D model, we define our velocity model as: using JUDI.TimeModeling # Grid n = (120, 100, 80) # (x,y,z) d = (10., 10., 10.) o = (0., 0., 0.) # Velocity [km/s] v = ones(Float32, n) .* 1.4f0 v[:, :, 40:end] .= 5f0 # Squared slowness and model structure m = (1f0 ./ v).^2 model = Model(n, d, o, m) Our source coordinates now also need to have the y-coordinate defined: # Set up source geometry nsrc = 4 # no. of sources xsrc = convertToCell(range(400f0, stop=800f0, length=nsrc)) ysrc = convertToCell(range(200f0, stop=1000f0, length=nsrc)) zsrc = convertToCell(range(20f0, stop=20f0, length=nsrc)) # Modeling time and sampling interval time = 1000f0 # ms dt = 2f0 # ms # Set up source structure src_geometry = Geometry(xsrc, ysrc, zsrc; dt=dt, t=time) Our source wavelet, is set up as in the 2D case: # Source wavelet f0 = 0.01f0 # kHz wavelet = ricker_wavelet(time, dt, f0) q = judiVector(src_geometry, wavelet) For the receivers, we generally need to define each coordinate (x, y, z) for every receiver. I.e. xrec , yrec and zrec each have the length of the total number of receivers. However, oftentimes we are interested in a regular receiver grid, which can be defined by two basis vectors and a constant depth value for all receivers. We can then use the setup_3D_grid helper function to create the full set of coordinates: # Receiver geometry nxrec = 120 nyrec = 100 xrec = range(50f0, stop=1150f0, length=nxrec) yrec = range(100f0, stop=900f0, length=nyrec) zrec = 50f0 # Construct 3D grid from basis vectors (xrec, yrec, zrec) = setup_3D_grid(xrec, yrec, zrec) # Set up receiver structure rec_geometry = Geometry(xrec, yrec, zrec; dt=dt, t=time, nsrc=nsrc) Setting up the modeling operators is done as in the previous 2D case: # Set up info structure for linear operators ntComp = get_computational_nt(src_geometry, rec_geometry, model) info = Info(prod(n), nsrc, ntComp) # Setup operators Pr = judiProjection(info, rec_geometry) A_inv = judiModeling(info, model) Ps = judiProjection(info, src_geometry) # Model data d_obs = Pr*A_inv*Ps'*q The 3D shot records are still saved as 2D arrays of dimensions time x (nxrec*nyrec) : using PyPlot imshow(d_obs.data[1], vmin=-.4, vmax=.4, cmap=\"seismic\", aspect=\"auto\") Vertical and tilted-transverse isotropic modeling (VTI, TTI) JUDI supports both VTI and TTI modeling based on a coupled pseudo-acoustic wave equation. To enable VTI/TTI modeling, simply pass Thomsen parameters as well as the tilt angles to the Model structure as optional keyword arguments: # Grid and model n = (120, 100, 80) d = (10., 10., 10) o = (0., 0., 0.) # Velocity v = ones(Float32, n) .* 1.5f0 m = 1f0 ./ v.^2 # Thomsen parameters epsilon = ones(Float32, n) .* 0.2f0 delta = ones(Float32, n) .* 0.1f0 # Tile angles for TTI theta = ones(Float32, n) .* pi/2f0 phi = ones(Float32, n) .* pi/3f0 # 3D only # Set up model structure with Thomsen parameters model = Model(n, d, o, m; rho=rho, epsilon=epsilon, delta=delta, theta=theta, delta=delta) Modeling with density To use density, pass rho in the units of [g/cm^3] as an optional keyword argument to the Model structure. The default density is rho=1f0 (i.e. density of water): # Grid and model n = (120, 100) d = (10., 10.) o = (0., 0.) v = ones(Float32, n) .* 1.5f0 m = 1f0 ./ v.^2 rho = ones(Float32, n) .* 1.1f0 # Set up model structure with density model = Model(n, d, o, m; rho=rho) 2D Marine streamer acquisition For a marine streamer acquisition, we need to define a moving set of receivers representing a streamer that is towed behind a seismic source vessel. In JUDI, this is easily done by defining a different set of receivers for each source location. Here, we explain how to set up the Geometry objects for a 2D marine streamer acquisition. If we define that our streamer is to the right side of the source vessel, this has the effect that part of the streamer is outside the grid while our vessel is in the right side of the model. To circumvent this, we can say that our streamer is on the right side of the source while the vessel is in the left-hand side of the model and vice versa. This way, we get the full maximum offset coverage for every source location (assuming that the maximum offset is less or equal than half the domain size). First, we have to specify our domain size (the physical extent of our model), as well as the number of receivers and the minimum and maximum offset: domain_x = (model.n[1] - 1)*model.d[1] # horizontal extent of model nrec = 120 # no. of receivers xmin = 50f0 # leave buffer zone w/o source and receivers of this size xmax = domain_x - 50f0 min_offset = 10f0 # distance between source and first receiver max_offset = 400f0 # distance between source and last xmid = domain_x / 2 # midpoint of model source_spacing = 25f0 # source interval [m] For the JUDI Geometry objects, we need to create cell arrays for the source and receiver coordinates, with one cell entry per source location: # Source/receivers nsrc = 20 # number of shot locations # Receiver coordinates xrec = Array{Any}(undef, nsrc) yrec = Array{Any}(undef, nsrc) zrec = Array{Any}(undef, nsrc) # Source coordinates xsrc = Array{Any}(undef, nsrc) ysrc = Array{Any}(undef, nsrc) zsrc = Array{Any}(undef, nsrc) Next, we compute the source and receiver coordinates for when the vessel moves from left to right in the right-hand side of the model: # Vessel goes from left to right in right-hand side of model nsrc_half = Int(nsrc/2) for j=1:nsrc_half xloc = xmid + (j-1)*source_spacing # Current receiver locations xrec[j] = range(xloc - max_offset, xloc - min_offset, length=nrec) yrec[j] = 0. zrec[j] = range(50f0, 50f0, length=nrec) # Current source xsrc[j] = xloc ysrc[j] = 0f0 zsrc[j] = 20f0 end Then, we repeat this for the case where the vessel goes from right to left in the left-hand model side: # Vessel goes from right to left in left-hand side of model for j=1:nsrc_half xloc = xmid - (j-1)*source_spacing # Current receiver locations xrec[nsrc_half + j] = range(xloc + min_offset, xloc + max_offset, length=nrec) yrec[nsrc_half + j] = 0f0 zrec[nsrc_half + j] = range(50f0, 50f0, length=nrec) # Current source xsrc[nsrc_half + j] = xloc ysrc[nsrc_half + j] = 0f0 zsrc[nsrc_half + j] = 20f0 end Finally, we can set the modeling time and sampling interval and create the Geometry objects: # receiver sampling and recording time time = 10000f0 # receiver recording time [ms] dt = 4f0 # receiver sampling interval # Set geometry objects rec_geometry = Geometry(xrec, yrec, zrec; dt=dt, t=time) src_geometry = Geometry(xsrc, ysrc, zsrc; dt=dt, t=time) You can find a full (reproducable) example for generating a marine streamer data set for the Sigsbee 2A model here . Simultaneous sources To set up a simultaneous source with JUDI, we first create a cell array with nsrc cells, where nsrc is the number of separate experiments (here nsrc=1 ). For a simultaneous source, we create an array of source coordinates for each cell entry. In fact, this is exactly like setting up the receiver geometry, in which case we define multiple receivers per shot location. Here, we define a single experiment with a simultaneous source consisting of four sources: nsrc = 1 # single simultaneous source xsrc = Array{Any}(undef, nsrc) ysrc = Array{Any}(undef, nsrc) zsrc = Array{Any}(undef, nsrc) # Set up source geometry xsrc[1] = [250f0, 500f0, 750f0, 1000f0] # four simultaneous sources ysrc[1] = 0f0 zsrc[1] = [50f0, 50f0, 50f0, 50f0] # Source sampling and number of time steps time = 2000f0 dt = 4f0 # Set up source structure src_geometry = Geometry(xsrc, ysrc, zsrc; dt=dt, t=time) With the simultaneous source geometry in place, we can now create our simultaneous data. As we have four sources per sim. source, we create an array of dimensions 4 x src_geometry.nt[1] and fill it with wavelets of different time shifts: # Create wavelet f0 = 0.01 # source peak frequencies q = ricker_wavelet(500f0, dt, f0) # 500 ms wavelet # Create array with different time shifts of the wavelet wavelet = zeros(Float32, 4, src_geometry.nt[1]) wavelet[1, 1:1+length(q)-1] = q wavelet[2, 41:41+length(q)-1] = q wavelet[3, 121:121+length(q)-1] = q wavelet[4, 201:201+length(q)-1] = q Finally, we create our simultaneous source as a judiVector : # Source wavelet q = judiVector(src_geometry, wavelet) Working with wavefields JUDI allows computing full time domain wavefields and using them as right-hand sides for wave equations solves. This tutorial shows how. We start by setting up a basic 2D experiment: using JUDI.TimeModeling # Grid n = (120, 100) # (x,z) d = (10., 10.) o = (0., 0.) # Velocity [km/s] v = ones(Float32, n) .* 1.4f0 v[:, 50:end] .= 5f0 # Squared slowness m = (1f0 ./ v).^2 # Model structure: model = Model(n, d, o, m) Next, we set up the source geometry for a single source experiment: # Set up source geometry nsrc = 1 # no. of sources xsrc = convertToCell([600f0]) ysrc = convertToCell([0f0]) zsrc = convertToCell([20f0]) # Modeling time and sampling interval time = 600f0 # ms dt = 4f0 # ms # Set up source structure src_geometry = Geometry(xsrc, ysrc, zsrc; dt=dt, t=time) # Source wavelet f0 = 0.01f0 # kHz wavelet = ricker_wavelet(time, dt, f0) q = judiVector(src_geometry, wavelet) As in the 2D quick start tutorial, we create our info structure, modeling operator and source projection operator: # Set up info structure for linear operators ntComp = get_computational_nt(src_geometry, model) info = Info(prod(n), nsrc, ntComp) # Setup operators A_inv = judiModeling(info, model) Ps = judiProjection(info, src_geometry) To model a wavefield, we simply omit the receiver sampling operator: u = A_inv*Ps'*q This return an abstract data vector called judiWavefield . Similar to judiVectors , we can access the data for each source number i via u.data[i] . The data is a 3D array of size (nt, nx, nz) for 2D and a 4D array of size (nt, nx, ny, nz) for 3D. We can plot the wavefield of the 600th time step with: using PyPlot imshow(u.data[1][600, :, :]', vmin=-5, vmax=5, cmap=\"seismic\", aspect=\"auto\") We can also use the computed wavefield u as a right-hand side for forward and adjoint wave equation solves: v = A_inv*u w = A_inv'*u Similarly, by setting up a receiver projection operator, we can use wavefields as right-hand sides, but restrict the output to the receiver locations. Extended source modeling JUDI supports extened source modeling, which injects a 1D wavelet q at every point in the subsurface weighted by a spatially varying extended source. To demonstrate extended source modeling, we first set up a runnable 2D experiment with JUDI. We start with defining the model: using JUDI.TimeModeling # Grid n = (120, 100) # (x,z) d = (10., 10.) o = (0., 0.) # Velocity [km/s] v = ones(Float32, n) .* 1.4f0 v[:, 50:end] .= 5f0 # Squared slowness m = (1f0 ./ v).^2 # Model structure: model = Model(n, d, o, m) Next, we set up the receiver geometry: # Number of experiments nsrc = 2 # Set up receiver geometry nxrec = 120 xrec = range(50f0, stop=1150f0, length=nxrec) yrec = 0f0 zrec = range(50f0, stop=50f0, length=nxrec) # Modeling time and receiver sampling interval time = 2000 dt = 4 # Set up receiver structure rec_geometry = Geometry(xrec, yrec, zrec; dt=dt, t=time, nsrc=nsrc) For the extended source, we do not need to set up a source geometry object, but we need to define a wavelet function: # Source wavelet f0 = 0.01f0 # MHz wavelet = ricker_wavelet(time, dt, f0) As before, we set up an info structure, as well as a modeling operator and a receiver sampling operator: # Set up info structure for linear operators ntComp = get_computational_nt(rec_geometry, model) info = Info(prod(n), nsrc, ntComp) # Setup operators A_inv = judiModeling(info, model) Pr = judiProjection(info, rec_geometry) We define our extended source as a so called judiWeights vector. Similar to a judiVector , the data of this abstract vector is stored as a cell array, where each cell corresponds to one source experiment. We create a cell array of length two and create a random array of the size of the model as our extended source: weights = Array{Array}(undef, nsrc) for j=1:nsrc weights[j] = randn(Float32, model.n) end w = judiWeights(weights) To inject the extended source into the model and weight it by the wavelet, we create a special projection operator called judiLRWF (for JUDI low-rank wavefield). This operator needs to know the wavelet we defined earlier. We can then create our full modeling operator, by combining Pw with A_inv and the receiver sampling operator: # Create operator for injecting the weights, multiplied by the provided wavelet(s) Pw = judiLRWF(info, wavelet) # Model observed data w/ extended source F = Pr*A_inv*adjoint(Pw) Extended source modeling supports both forward and adjoint modeling: # Simultaneous observed data d_sim = F*w dw = adjoint(F)*d_sim As for regular modeling, we can create a Jacobian for linearized modeling and migration. First we define a migration velocity model and the corresponding modeling operator A0_inv : # Migration velocity and squared slowness v0 = ones(Float32, n) .* 1.4f0 m0 = (1f0 ./ v0).^2 # Model structure and modeling operator for migration velocity model0 = Model(n, d, o, m0) A0_inv = judiModeling(info, model0) # Jacobian and RTM J = judiJacobian(Pr*A0_inv*adjoint(Pw), w) rtm = adjoint(J)*d_sim As before, we can plot the image after reshaping it into its original dimensions: rtm = reshape(rtm, model.n) imshow(rtm', cmap=\"gray\", vmin=-3e6, vmax=3e6) Please also refer to the reproducable example on github for 2D and 3D extended modeling. Impedance imaging (inverse scattering) JUDI supports imaging (RTM) and demigration (linearized modeling) using the linearized inverse scattering imaging condition (ISIC) and its corresponding adjoint. ISIC can be enabled via the Options class. You can set this options when you initially create the modeling operator: # Options strucuture opt = Options(isic=true) # Set up modeling operator A0_inv = judiModeling(info, model0; options=opt) When you create a Jacobian from a forward modeling operator, the Jacobian inherits the options from A0_inv : J = judiJacobian(Pr*A0_inv*Ps', q) J.options.isic # -> true Alternatively, you can directly set the option in your Jacobian: J.options.isic = true # enable isic J.options.isic = false # disable isic Optimal checkpointing JUDI supports optimal checkpointing via Devito's interface to the Revolve library. To enable checkpointing, use the Options class: # Options strucuture opt = Options(optimal_checkpointing=true) # Set up modeling operator A0_inv = judiModeling(info, model0; options=opt) When you create a Jacobian from a forward modeling operator, the Jacobian inherits the options from A0_inv : J = judiJacobian(Pr*A0_inv*Ps', q) J.options.optimal_checkpointing # -> true Alternatively, you can directly set the option in your Jacobian: J.options.optimal_checkpointing = true # enable checkpointing J.options.optimal_checkpointing = false # disable checkpointing On-the-fly Fourier transforms JUDI supports seismic imaging in the frequency domain using on-the-fly discrete Fourier transforms (DFTs). To compute an RTM image in the frequency domain for a given set of frequencies, we first create a cell array for the frequencies of each source experiment: nsrc = 4 # assume 4 source experiments frequencies = Array{Any}(undef, nsrc) Now we can define single or multiple frequencies for each shot location for which the RTM image will be computed: # For every source location, compute RTM image for 10 and 20 Hz for j=1:nsrc frequencies[j] = [0.001, 0.002] end The frequencies are passed to the Jacobian via the options field. Assuming we already have a Jacobian set up, we set the frequencies via: J.options.frequencies = frequencies Instead of the same two frequencies for each source experiment, we could have chosen different random sets of frequencies, which creates an RTM with incoherent noise. We can also draw random frequencies using the frequency spectrum of the true source as the probability density function. To create a distribution for a given source q ( judiVector ) from which we can draw frequency samples, use: q_dist = generate_distribution(q) Then we can assigne a random set of frequencies in a specified range as follows: nfreq = 10 # no. of frequencies per source location for j=1:nsrc J.options.frequencies[j] = select_frequencies(q_dist; fmin=0.003, fmax=0.04, nf=nfreq) end Once the options.frequencies field is set, on-the-fly DFTs are used for both born modeling and RTM. To save computational cost, we can limit the number of DFTs that are performed. Rather than computing the DFT at every time step, we can define a subsampling factor as follows: # Compute DFT every 4 time steps J.options.dft_subsampling_factor=4","title":"Tutorials"},{"location":"tutorials/#tutorials","text":"These tutorials provide instructions of how to set up various modeling or inversion scenarios with JUDI.

Optionally, we can provide an array of the density in [g/cm^3] (by default a density of 1 is used): # Density (optional) rho = ones(Float32, n) # Model structure: model = Model(n, d, o, m; rho=rho) Next, we define our source acquisition geometry, which needs to be defined as a Geometry structure. The Geometry function requires the x-, y- and z-coordinates of the source locations as input, as well as the modeling time and samping interval of the wavelet. In general, each parameter can be passed as a cell array, where each cell entry provides the information for the respective source location. The helper function convertToCell converts a Julia range to a cell array, which makes defining the source geometry easier: # Set up source geometry nsrc = 4 # no. of sources xsrc = convertToCell(range(400f0, stop=800f0, length=nsrc)) ysrc = convertToCell(range(0f0, stop=0f0, length=nsrc)) zsrc = convertToCell(range(20f0, stop=20f0, length=nsrc)) # Modeling time and sampling interval time = 1000f0 # ms dt = 2f0 # ms # Set up source structure src_geometry = Geometry(xsrc, ysrc, zsrc; dt=dt, t=time) Now we can define our source wavelet. The source must be defined as a judiVector , which takes the source geometry, as well as the source data (i.e. the wavelet) as an input argument: # Source wavelet f0 = 0.01f0 # kHz wavelet = ricker_wavelet(time, dt, f0) q = judiVector(src_geometry, wavelet) In general, wavelet can be a cell array with a different wavelet in each cell, i.e. for every source location. Here, we want to use the same wavelet for all 4 source experiments, so we can simply pass a single vector. As we already specified in our src_geometry object that we want to have 4 source locations, judiVector will automaticallty copy the wavelet for every experiment. Next, we set up the receiver acquisition geometry. Here, we define an OBN acquisition, where the receivers are spread out over the entire domain and each source experiment uses the same set of receivers. Again, we can in principle pass the coordinates as cell arrays, with one cell per source location. Since we want to use the same geometry for every source, we can use a short cut and define the coordinates as Julia ranges and pass nsrc=nsrc as an optional argument to the Geometry function. This tells the function that we want to use our receiver set up for nsrc distinct source experiments: # Set up receiver geometry (for 2D, set yrec to zero) nxrec = 120 xrec = range(50f0, stop=1150f0, length=nxrec) yrec = 0f0 zrec = range(50f0, stop=50f0, length=nxrec) # Set up receiver structure rec_geometry = Geometry(xrec, yrec, zrec; dt=dt, t=time, nsrc=nsrc) With our model and source and receiver geometries in place, we can proceed to defining our linear operator for seismic modeling. First, we need to define an info object, which contains some basic dimensionality information that needs to be shared between operators so that they can determine their size: # Set up info structure for linear operators ntComp = get_computational_nt(src_geometry, rec_geometry, model) info = Info(prod(n), nsrc, ntComp) Next, we can define separate operators for source/receiver projections and a forward modeling operator: # Setup operators Pr = judiProjection(info, rec_geometry) A_inv = judiModeling(info, model) Ps = judiProjection(info, src_geometry) We can see, that from JUDI's perspective, source and receivers are treated equally and are represented by the same operators ( judiProjection ) and vectors ( judiVector ). We also could've skipped setting up the projection operators and directly created: F = judiModeling(info, model, src_geometry, rec_geometry) which is equivalent to creating the combined operator: F = Pr*A_inv*Ps' Finally, to model our seismic data, we run: d_obs = Pr*A_inv*Ps'*q # or d_obs = F*q We can plot a 2D shot record by accessing the .data field of the judiVector , which contains the data in the original (non-vectorized) dimensions: using PyPlot imshow(d_obs.data[1], vmin=-5, vmax=5, cmap=\"seismic\", aspect=\"auto\") We can also set up a Jacobian operator for Born modeling and reverse-time migration. First we set up a (constant) migration velocity model: v0 = ones(Float32, n) .* 1.4f0 m0 = (1f0 ./ v0).^2 dm = m - m0 # model perturbation/image # Model structure model0 = Model(n, d, o, m0) We can create the Jacobian directly from a (non-linear) modeling operator and a source vector: A0_inv = judiModeling(info, model0) # modeling operator for migration velocity J = judiJacobian(Pr*A0_inv*Ps', q) We can use this operator to model single scattered data, as well as for migration our previous data: d_lin = J*vec(dm) # RTM rtm = J'*d_obs To plot, first reshape the image: rtm = reshape(rtm, model0.n) imshow(rtm', cmap=\"gray\", vmin=-1e3, vmax=1e3)","title":"2D Modeling Quickstart"},{"location":"tutorials/#3d-modeling-quickstart","text":"Setting up a 3D experiment largely follows the instructions for the 2D example.

To demonstrate extended source modeling, we first set up a runnable 2D experiment with JUDI.

Similar to a judiVector , the data of this abstract vector is stored as a cell array, where each cell corresponds to one source experiment. We create a cell array of length two and create a random array of the size of the model as our extended source: weights = Array{Array}(undef, nsrc) for j=1:nsrc weights[j] = randn(Float32, model.n) end w = judiWeights(weights) To inject the extended source into the model and weight it by the wavelet, we create a special projection operator called judiLRWF (for JUDI low-rank wavefield). This operator needs to know the wavelet we defined earlier. We can then create our full modeling operator, by combining Pw with A_inv and the receiver sampling operator: # Create operator for injecting the weights, multiplied by the provided wavelet(s) Pw = judiLRWF(info, wavelet) # Model observed data w/ extended source F = Pr*A_inv*adjoint(Pw) Extended source modeling supports both forward and adjoint modeling: # Simultaneous observed data d_sim = F*w dw = adjoint(F)*d_sim As for regular modeling, we can create a Jacobian for linearized modeling and migration. First we define a migration velocity model and the corresponding modeling operator A0_inv : # Migration velocity and squared slowness v0 = ones(Float32, n) .* 1.4f0 m0 = (1f0 ./ v0).^2 # Model structure and modeling operator for migration velocity model0 = Model(n, d, o, m0) A0_inv = judiModeling(info, model0) # Jacobian and RTM J = judiJacobian(Pr*A0_inv*adjoint(Pw), w) rtm = adjoint(J)*d_sim As before, we can plot the image after reshaping it into its original dimensions: rtm = reshape(rtm, model.n) imshow(rtm', cmap=\"gray\", vmin=-3e6, vmax=3e6) Please also refer to the reproducable example on github for 2D and 3D extended modeling.","title":"Extended source modeling"},{"location":"tutorials/#impedance-imaging-inverse-scattering","text":"JUDI supports imaging (RTM) and demigration (linearized modeling) using the linearized inverse scattering imaging condition (ISIC) and its corresponding adjoint.

We can also draw random frequencies using the frequency spectrum of the true source as the probability density function. To create a distribution for a given source q ( judiVector ) from which we can draw frequency samples, use: q_dist = generate_distribution(q) Then we can assigne a random set of frequencies in a specified range as follows: nfreq = 10 # no. of frequencies per source location for j=1:nsrc J.options.frequencies[j] = select_frequencies(q_dist; fmin=0.003, fmax=0.04, nf=nfreq) end Once the options.frequencies field is set, on-the-fly DFTs are used for both born modeling and RTM.

This library requires objective functions with the current variable and gradient as input arguments and the function value as the only output argument. For this reason, we build a wrapper that is customized for the NLopt library around our fwi_objective function. The function f! takes a vectorized estimate of the current model as well as the (vectorized) gradient as input arguments. NLopt uses double precision for floating point variables, so the first step inside f! is to reshape and convert the model to single precision. Then we choose a randomized subset of sources and shot records and compute the function value fval and gradient of the FWI objective function. We then set the gradient in the water layer to zero and overwrite the input gradient grad with the new gradient. Furthermore, we keep track of the number of function evaluations through increasing the count variable, which will serve as the termination criterion for the algorithm. In Julia, we set up f! in the following way: batchsize = 8; count = 0; # NLopt objective function function f!(x, grad) global count if count == 0 @printf(\"%10s %15s %15s\\n\",\"Iteration\",\"Function Val\",\"norm(g)\") end # Update model model0.m = Float32.(reshape(x,model0.n)) # Seclect batch and calculate gradient i = randperm(d_obs.nsrc)[1:batchsize] fval, gradient = fwi_objective(model0, q[i], d_obs[i]) # Reset gradient in water column to zero gradient = reshape(gradient, model0.n) gradient[:,1:21] .= 0f0 grad[1:end] = vec(gradient) global count; count += 1 @printf(\"%10d %15.5e %15.5e\\n\",count, fval, norm(g)) return convert(Float64, fval) end UndefVarError: @printf not defined g = zeros(prod(model0.n)) f0 = f!(vec(model0.m), g) # Reset count global count = 0; 1 255339.66398837214 262117.01773563828 255339.66398837214 imshow(reshape(g, model0.n)', vmin=-1e3, vmax=1e3, extent=(0,10,3,0), cmap=\"jet\") title(\"FWI first gradient\") xlabel(\"Lateral position [km]\"); ylabel(\"Depth [km]\"); As in our gradient descent and Gauss-Newton example, we define bound constraints for the squared slowness to prevent velocities from becoming negative or too large: # Set up bound constrains v0 = sqrt.(1f0./model0.m) vmin = ones(Float32, model0.n) .* 1.3f0; vmax = ones(Float32, model0.n) .* 6.5f0; # Convert to squared slowness mmin = vec((1f0 ./ vmax).^2); mmax = vec((1f0 ./ vmin).^2); The NLopt library offers a range of different optimization algorithms, from which we choose the L-BFGS method. We create an optimization object called opt by specifying the algorithm we want to use and the dimenions of the unknown model vector. We then set the upper and lower bounds of the variable, define f! as the objective function and set the termination criterion to be a maximum of 15 function evaluations: opt = Opt(:LD_LBFGS, prod(model0.n)) lower_bounds!(opt, mmin) upper_bounds!(opt, mmax) min_objective!(opt, f!) maxeval!(opt, 15) Remark: Subsampling the number of sources should in practice never be used for second order methods such as L-BFGS. Specialized stochastic second order methods exist, but differ from standard Quasi-Newton methods. We only use source subsampling to reduce the computational cost of our example. Having set up the objective function, bound constraints and termination criterion, we can now run the inversion: This example requires ~200 MB of memory per gradient, i.e. 800 MB with four parallel workers. It runs for approximately 15 minutes.

For discretizing and solving wave equations, we use Devito , a Python-based domain-specific language for automated generation of finite-difference code (Lange et al., 2016). The first two parts of this tutorial (Louboutin et al., 2017, 2018) demonstrated how to solve the acoustic wave equation for modeling seismic shot records and how to compute the gradient of the FWI objective function using the adjoint-state method. With these two key ingredients, we will now build an inversion framework that can be used to minimize the FWI least-squares objective function. FWI is a computationally and mathematically challenging problem. The computational complexity comes from the fact that an already expensive solution procedure for the wave equation needs to be repeated for a large number of source positions for each iteration of the optimization algorithm. The mathematical complexity comes from the fact that the FWI objective is known to have many local minima due to cycle skipping. NOT FOR MANUSCRIPT Furthermore, since the solution is not unique it is generally not possible to unambiguously recover the parameterization of the subsurface from the given data alone, making FWI an active field of research (e.g. Leeuwen et al., 2013; Warner and Guasch, 2014; Peters and Herrmann, 2017). This tutorial demonstrates how we can set up a basic FWI framework with two alternative gradient-based optimization algorithms: stochastic gradient descent, and the Gauss\u2013Newton method (Nocedal and Wright, 2009). We implement our inversion framework with the Julia Devito Inversion framework (JUDI), a parallel software package for seismic modeling and inversion in the Julia programming language. JUDI provides abstractions and function wrappers that allow the implementation of wave-equation-based inversion problems such as FWI using code that closely follows the mathematical notation, while using Devito\u2019s automatic code generation for solving the underlying wave equations. All the code to run the algorithms and generate the figures in this paper can be found at http://github.com/SEG. Optimizing the FWI objective function The goal of this tutorial series is to optimize the FWI objective function with the $\\ell_2$-misfit: $$ \\mathop{\\hbox{minimize}} {\\mathbf{m}} \\hspace{.2cm} f(\\mathbf{m})= \\sum {i=1}^{n_s} \\frac{1}{2} \\left\\lVert \\mathbf{d}^\\mathrm{pred}_i (\\mathbf{m}, \\mathbf{q}_i) - \\mathbf{d}_i^\\mathrm{obs} \\right\\rVert_2^2, $$ where $\\mathbf{d}^\\mathrm{pred}_i$ and $\\mathbf{d}^\\mathrm{obs}_i$ are the predicted and observed seismic shot records of the $i^{\\text{th}}$ source location and $\\mathbf{m}$ is the velocity model (expressed as squared slowness). In part one, we demonstrated how to implement a forward modeling operator to generate the predicted shot records, which we will denote as $\\mathbf{d}^\\mathrm{pred}_i = \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{m},\\mathbf{q}_i)$. In the second tutorial, we then showed how we can compute the gradient $\\nabla f(\\mathbf{m})$ of the objective function and update our initial model using gradient descent. There is a snag, however. This first-order optimization algorithm has a linear convergence rate at best, and typically requires many iterations to converge. Second-order optimization methods converge considerably faster. To implement them, we first approximate the objective with a second-order Taylor expansion: $$ f(\\mathbf{m}) = f(\\mathbf{m}_0) + \\nabla f(\\mathbf{m}_0) \\delta \\mathbf{m} + \\delta \\mathbf{m}^\\top \\nabla^2 f(\\mathbf{m}_0) \\delta \\mathbf{m} + \\mathcal{O}(\\delta \\mathbf{m}^3), $$ where $\\mathcal{O}(\\delta \\mathbf{m}^3)$ represents the error term, $\\nabla f(\\mathbf{m}_0)$ is the gradient as implemented in part two, and $\\nabla^2 f(\\mathbf{m}_0)$ is the Hessian of the objective function, which we will refer to as $\\mathbf{H}$. Rather than using the negative gradient to incrementally update our model, as in gradient descent, we directly calculate a model update $\\delta \\mathbf{m}$ that leads us to the minimum. This is called Newton's method: $$ \\delta \\mathbf{m} = - \\mathbf{H}(\\mathbf{m}_0)^{-1} \\nabla f(\\mathbf{m}_0). $$ Although the method converges to the minimum of the FWI objective function quickly, it comes at the cost of having to compute and invert the Hessian matrix (Nocedal and Wright, 2009). Fortunately, for least squares problems, such as FWI, the Hessian can be approximated by the Gauss-Newton (GN) Hessian $\\mathbf{J}^\\top \\mathbf{J}$, where $\\mathbf{J}$ is the Jacobian matrix. This is the partial derivative of the forward modeling operator $\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{m},\\mathbf{q})$ with respect to $\\mathbf{m}$ \u2014 something we can easily compute. Furthermore, the Jacobian can also be used to express the gradient of the FWI objective function as $\\nabla f(\\mathbf{m} 0) = \\mathbf{J}^\\top (\\mathbf{d}^\\mathrm{pred}_i - \\mathbf{d}_i^\\mathrm{obs})$, where $\\mathbf{J}^\\top$ is the adjoint (transposed) Jacobian. This is useful, because we now have a set of operators $\\mathbf{F}, \\mathbf{J}$ and $\\mathbf{H} {GN}=\\mathbf{J}^\\top\\mathbf{J}$, through which we can express both first and second order optimization algorithms for FWI. Although forming these matrices explicitly is not possible, since they can become extremely large, we only need the action of these operators on vectors. This allows us to implement these operators matrix-free. In the following section we will demonstrate how to set up these operators in our JUDI software framework and to how to use them to implement FWI algorithms. NOT FOR MANUSCRIPT [SegyIO]:https://github.com/slimgroup/SegyIO.jl The Julia Devito Inversion framework is a parallel matrix-free linear operator library for seismic modeling and inversion based on Devito and [SeisIO], a performant Julia package for reading and writing large data volumes in SEG-Y format. JUDI allows implementing seismic inversion algorithms as linear algebra operations, enabling rapid translations of FWI algorithms to executable Julia code. The underlying wave equations are set up and solved using Devito, as described in the first two tutorials, and are interfaced from Julia using the [PyCall](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyCall.jl) package (Johnson, 2017). For reading and writing SEG-Y data, JUDI uses the SeisIO package, a sophisticated SEG-Y reader that allows us to scan large 3D data sets for creating look-up tables with header summaries. However, since our data set is relatively small, we will directly load the full file into memory. The `segy_read` command takes the file name as an input and returns a dense data block. This is our observed data and we store it as a JUDI vector. # NOT FOR MANUSCRIPT # using Distributed # addprocs(4); using JUDI.TimeModeling, JUDI.SLIM_optim, SegyIO, Random, Statistics Implementing FWI in JUDI We start our demonstration by reading our data set, which consists of 16 shot records and was generated with an excerpt from the SEG/EAGE Overthrust model (Aminzadeh et al. 1997). We store it as a judiVector : block = segy_read(\"overthrust_shot_records.segy\") d_obs = judiVector(block); using PyPlot i = 8 figure(figsize=(15,6)) imshow(d_obs.data[i], cmap=\"seismic\", extent=[0,size(d_obs.data[i],2),2,0], aspect=\"auto\", vmin=-3, vmax=3) xlabel(\"Receiver number\", size=12) ylabel(\"Time [s]\", size=12) text(3, 0.13, \"Shot record $i\", size=16) show() Figure 1 : Observed shot record number 8. JUDI vectors such as d_obs can be used like a regular Julia vectors, so we can compute norms via norm(d_obs) or the inner product via dot(d_obs, d_obs) , but they contain the shot records in their original dimension. Shot records can be accessed via their respective shot number with d_obs.data[shot_no] , while the header information can be accessed with d_obs.geometry . We extract the source geometry from our SEG-Y file and then manually set up a source vector q with an 8 Hz Ricker wavelet: f = 0.008 # kHz src_geom = Geometry(block; key=\"source\") src_data = ricker_wavelet(src_geom.t[1], src_geom.dt[1], f) q = judiVector(src_geom, src_data); plot(q.data[1]) show() NOT FOR MANUSCRIPT Since our data set consists of $16$ shot records, both `d_obs` and `q` contain the data and geometries for all source positions. We can check the number of source positions with `d_obs.nsrc` and `q.nsrc` and we can extract the part of the vector that corresponds to one or multiple shots with `d_obs[shot_no], q[shot_no]`. We will now set up the forward modeling operator $\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{m},\\mathbf{q})$ as a matrix-free operator for the inverse wave equation $\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{m})^{-1}$, where $\\mathbf{m}$ is the current model, and source/receiver injection and sampling operators $\\mathbf{P} \\mathrm{s}$ and $\\mathbf{P} \\mathrm{r}$. Since the dimensions of the inverse wave equation operator depend on the number of computational time steps, we calculate this number using the get_computational_nt function and set up an info object that contains some dimensionality information required by all operators. Then we can define Pr and Ps as matrix-free operators implementing Devito sparse point injection and interpolation (Louboutin et al., 2017). Multiplications with Ps and Pr represent sampling the wavefield at source/receiver locations, while their adjoints Ps', Pr' denote injecting either source wavelets or shot records into the computational grid. These projection and modelling operators can then be set up in Julia in the following way: using HDF5 m0, n, d, o = read(h5open(\"overthrust_model.h5\",\"r\"),\"m0\",\"n\",\"d\",\"o\") model0 = Model((n[1],n[2]), (d[1],d[2]), (o[1],o[2]), m0); ntComp = get_computational_nt(q.geometry, d_obs.geometry, model0) info = Info(prod(model0.n), d_obs.nsrc, ntComp) Pr = judiProjection(info, d_obs.geometry) Ps = judiProjection(info, q.geometry) Ainv = judiModeling(info, model0); The forward modeling step can be expressed mathematically as $$ F(\\mathbf{m};\\mathbf{q})=\\mathbf{P}_r\\mathbf{A}^{-1}(\\mathbf{m})\\mathbf{P}_s^\\top\\mathbf{q} $$ which is expressed in Julia as d_pred = Pr * Ainv * Ps' * q This forward models all 16 predicted shot records in parallel. Notice that, in instantiating Ainv , we made the wave equation solver implicitly dependent on model0 . Finally, we set up the matrix-free Jacobian operator J and the Gauss\u2013Newton Hessian J' * J . As mentioned in the introduction, J is the partial derivative of the forward modeling operator $\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{m}, \\mathbf{q})$ with respect to the model m and is therefore directly constructed from our modeling operator Pr * Ainv * Ps' and a specified source vector q : J = judiJacobian(Pr * Ainv * Ps', q); NOT FOR MANUSCRIPT Note that, if we started our Julia session with multiple CPU cores or nodes (`julia -p n`, with `n` being the number of workers), the wave equation solves are automatically parallelized over source locations and all shots are collected in the `d_pred` vector. We can also model a single or subset of shots by indexing the operators with the respective shot numbers. E.g. if we want to model the first two shots, we define `i=[1,2]` and then run `d_sub = Pr[i]*Ainv[i]*Ps[i]'*q[i]`. The FWI gradient would then be given by: `g = J[i]' * (d_pred - d_obs[i])` If we want to solve an adjoint wave equation with the observed data as the adjoint source and restrictions of the wavefields back to the source locations, we can simply run `qad = Ps * Ainv' * Pr' * d_obs`, exemplifying the advantages of casting FWI in a proper computational linear algebra framework. Once we have `J` we can also form the Gauss\u2013Newton Hessian: `H_GN = J' * J` In the context of seismic inversion, the Jacobian is also called the linearized modeling or demigration operator and its adjoint J' is the migration operator. One drawback of this notation is that the forward wavefields for the gradient calculation have to be recomputed, since the forward modeling operator only returns the shot records and not the complete wavefields. For this reason, JUDI has an additional function for computing the gradients of the FWI objective function f,g = fwi_objective(model0,q[i],d_obs[i]) , which takes the current model, source and data vectors as an input and computes the objective value and gradient in parallel without having to recompute the forward wavefields. FWI via gradient descent With expressions for modeling operators, Jacobians and gradients of the FWI objective, we can now implement different FWI algorithms in a few lines of code. We will start with a basic gradient descent example with a line search. To reduce the computational cost of full gradient descent, we will use a stochastic approach in which we only compute the gradient and function value for a randomized subset of source locations. In JUDI, this is accomplished by choosing a random vector of integers between 1 and 16 and indexing the data vectors as described earlier. Furthermore, we will apply a projection operator proj(x) , which prevent velocities (or squared slownesses) becoming negative or too large by clipping values outside the allowed range. A few extra variables are defined in the notebook, but the full algorithm for FWI with stochastic gradient descent and box constraints is implemented as follows: # Set up bound constraints. v0 = sqrt.(1f0./model0.m) vmin = ones(Float32, model0.n) .* 1.3f0 vmax = ones(Float32, model0.n) .* 6.5f0 # Fix water column. vmin[:,1:21] = v0[:,1:21] vmax[:,1:21] = v0[:,1:21] # Convert to squared slowness. mmin = vec((1f0./vmax).^2) mmax = vec((1f0./vmin).^2); maxiter = 10 batchsize = 8 # Number of shots for each iteration. proj(x) = reshape(median([vec(mmin) vec(x) vec(mmax)], dims=2), model0.n) fhistory_SGD = zeros(Float32, maxiter); for j=1:maxiter # FWI objective function value and gradient. i = randperm(d_obs.nsrc)[1:batchsize] fval, grad = fwi_objective(model0, q[i], d_obs[i]) fhistory_SGD[j] = fval # Line search and update model. update = backtracking_linesearch(model0, q[i], d_obs[i], fval, grad, proj; alpha=1f0) model0.m += reshape(update, model0.n) # Apply box constraints. model0.m = proj(model0.m) end model_SGD = copy(model0.m); JUDI's backtracking_linesearch function performs an approximate line search and returns a model update that leads to a decrease of the objective function value (Armijo condition; Nocedal and Wright, 2009). The result after 10 iterations of SGD with box constraints is shown in Figure 2. In practice, where starting models are typically less accurate than in our example, FWI is often performed from low to high frequencies, since the objective function has less local minima for lower frequencies (Bunks et al., 1995). In this multi-scale FWI approach, a low-pass filtered version of the data is used to invert for a low resolution velocity model first and higher frequencies are added in subsequent iterations. FWI via the Gauss\u2013Newton method As discussed earlier, the convergence rate of GD depends on the objective function, but requires many FWI iterations necessary to reach an acceptable solution. Using our matrix-free operator for the Jacobian J, we can modify the above code to implement the Gauss\u2013Newton method (Equation 3) to improve the convergence rate. In practice, directly inverting the Gauss\u2013Newton Hessian J'* J should be avoided, because the matrix is badly conditioned and takes many iterations to invert. Instead, we perform a few iterations of a least-squares solver, lsqr() , to approximately solve J * p = d_pred - d_obs and obtain the update direction p . lsqr , from the Julia IterativeSolvers package, is a conjugate-gradient type algorithm for solving least squares problems and is mathematically equivalent to inverting J' * J , but has better numerical properties (Paige and Saunders, 1982). We implement the Gauss-Newton method as follows: model0.m = m0 # Reset velocity model. fhistory_GN = zeros(Float32,maxiter); using IterativeSolvers # Return data as Julia array Ainv.options.return_array = true d_vec = convert_to_array(d_obs) for j=1:maxiter # Model predicted data. d_pred = Pr * Ainv * Ps' * q # GN update direction. p = lsqr(J, d_pred - d_obs; maxiter=6) fhistory_GN[j] = .5f0 * norm(d_pred - d_vec)^2 # OMIT LINE FROM MANUSCRIPT # update model and box constraints. model0.m = model0.m - reshape(p, model0.n) end NOT FOR MANUSCRIPT An important benefit of matrix-free operators is that we do not need to implement our own least-squares solver, but can pass `J` and the data residual `d_pred - d_obs` to a third-party optimization library. The operator `J` does not need to be an explicit matrix, since `lsqr` only uses matrix-vector products. In contrast to our SGD algorithm, we use all shot records in every iteration, since stochastic methods for second order algorithms are less well understood, making this approach considerably more expensive than our previous algorithm. However, as shown in figures 2 and 3, it achieves a superior result, with a considerably lower misfit compared to the known model. Furthermore, figure 3 shows that it achieves the improved result in relatively few iterations. figure(figsize=(15, 12)) subplot(311) imshow(sqrt.(1f0./m0)', cmap=\"GnBu\", extent=(0,10,3,0), vmin=1.5, vmax=5.4) text(0.15, 0.3, \"Starting model\", size=14, color=\"black\") ylabel(\"Depth [km]\", size=12) colorbar() text(10.35, 1.5, \"Velocity [km/s]\", va=\"center\", size=12, rotation=90) subplot(312) imshow(sqrt.(1f0./model_SGD)', cmap=\"GnBu\", extent=(0,10,3,0), vmin=1.5, vmax=5.4) misfit = round(fhistory_SGD[end]) text(0.15, 0.3, \"Gradient descent, misfit = $misfit\", size=14, color=\"black\") ylabel(\"Depth [km]\", size=12) colorbar() text(10.35, 1.5, \"Velocity [km/s]\", va=\"center\", size=12, rotation=90) subplot(313) imshow(sqrt.(1f0./model0.m)', cmap=\"GnBu\", extent=(0,10,3,0), vmin=1.5, vmax=5.4) misfit = round(fhistory_GN[end]) text(0.15, 0.3, \"Gauss\u2013Newton, misfit = $misfit\", size=14, color=\"black\") xlabel(\"Lateral position [km]\", size=12) ylabel(\"Depth [km]\", size=12) colorbar() text(10.35, 1.5, \"Velocity [km/s]\", va=\"center\", size=12, rotation=90) show() fhistory_SGD = fhistory_SGD/norm(fhistory_SGD, Inf) fhistory_GN = fhistory_GN/norm(fhistory_GN, Inf); figure(figsize=(8,3)) plot(1:10, fhistory_SGD, label=\"Gradient descent\") plot(1:10, fhistory_GN, label=\"Gauss\u2013Newton\") text(9.8, 0.28, \"Gradient descent\", ha=\"right\", color=\"steelblue\") text(9.8, 0.09, \"Gauss\u2013Newton\", ha=\"right\", color=\"chocolate\") xlabel(\"Iteration number\", size=12) ylabel(\"Misfit\", size=12) xlim(1, 10) show() Figure 3 : Normalized function values for the FWI inversion example with stochastic gradient descent and the Gauss-Newton method. An alternative to (Gauss\u2013)Newton methods are quasi-Newton methods, which build up an approximation of the Hessian from previous gradients only and require no additional PDE solves or matrix inversions. Implementing an efficient and correct version of this method, such as the L-BFGS algorithm, exceeds a few lines of code and we therefore leave this exercise to the reader. Instead of implementing more complicated algorithms by hand, it is also possible to interface third-party Julia optimization libraries and an example for this is given in the notebook fwi_example_NLopt.ipynb . Even though all examples shown here are two-dimensional, in order to make them reproducible on a laptop or desktop PC, JUDI can be used for 3D modeling and inversion without having to change the code, since the number of dimensions are automatically inferred from the velocity model and data dimensions. Conclusions In this final part of our FWI tutorial series, we demonstrated how to set up basic optimization algorithms for waveform inversion using JUDI. The methods shown here are all gradient based and differ in the way how update directions for the velocity model are computed. Our numerical examples can serve for the reader as a basis for developing more advanced FWI workflows, which usually include additional data preprocessing, frequency continuation techniques or further model constraints.

We extract the source geometry from our SEG-Y file and then manually set up a source vector q with an 8 Hz Ricker wavelet: f = 0.008 # kHz src_geom = Geometry(block; key=\"source\") src_data = ricker_wavelet(src_geom.t[1], src_geom.dt[1], f) q = judiVector(src_geom, src_data); plot(q.data[1]) show()","title":"Implementing FWI in JUDI"},{"location":"tutorials/judi_leading_edge_tutorial/#fwi-via-gradient-descent","text":"With expressions for modeling operators, Jacobians and gradients of the FWI objective, we can now implement different FWI algorithms in a few lines of code. We will start with a basic gradient descent example with a line search. To reduce the computational cost of full gradient descent, we will use a stochastic approach in which we only compute the gradient and function value for a randomized subset of source locations. In JUDI, this is accomplished by choosing a random vector of integers between 1 and 16 and indexing the data vectors as described earlier. Furthermore, we will apply a projection operator proj(x) , which prevent velocities (or squared slownesses) becoming negative or too large by clipping values outside the allowed range. A few extra variables are defined in the notebook, but the full algorithm for FWI with stochastic gradient descent and box constraints is implemented as follows: # Set up bound constraints. v0 = sqrt.(1f0./model0.m) vmin = ones(Float32, model0.n) .* 1.3f0 vmax = ones(Float32, model0.n) .* 6.5f0 # Fix water column. vmin[:,1:21] = v0[:,1:21] vmax[:,1:21] = v0[:,1:21] # Convert to squared slowness. mmin = vec((1f0./vmax).^2) mmax = vec((1f0./vmin).^2); maxiter = 10 batchsize = 8 # Number of shots for each iteration. proj(x) = reshape(median([vec(mmin) vec(x) vec(mmax)], dims=2), model0.n) fhistory_SGD = zeros(Float32, maxiter); for j=1:maxiter # FWI objective function value and gradient. i = randperm(d_obs.nsrc)[1:batchsize] fval, grad = fwi_objective(model0, q[i], d_obs[i]) fhistory_SGD[j] = fval # Line search and update model. update = backtracking_linesearch(model0, q[i], d_obs[i], fval, grad, proj; alpha=1f0) model0.m += reshape(update, model0.n) # Apply box constraints. model0.m = proj(model0.m) end model_SGD = copy(model0.m); JUDI's backtracking_linesearch function performs an approximate line search and returns a model update that leads to a decrease of the objective function value (Armijo condition; Nocedal and Wright, 2009). The result after 10 iterations of SGD with box constraints is shown in Figure 2. In practice, where starting models are typically less accurate than in our example, FWI is often performed from low to high frequencies, since the objective function has less local minima for lower frequencies (Bunks et al., 1995). In this multi-scale FWI approach, a low-pass filtered version of the data is used to invert for a low resolution velocity model first and higher frequencies are added in subsequent iterations.","title":"FWI via gradient descent"},{"location":"tutorials/judi_leading_edge_tutorial/#fwi-via-the-gaussnewton-method","text":"As discussed earlier, the convergence rate of GD depends on the objective function, but requires many FWI iterations necessary to reach an acceptable solution. Using our matrix-free operator for the Jacobian J, we can modify the above code to implement the Gauss\u2013Newton method (Equation 3) to improve the convergence rate. In practice, directly inverting the Gauss\u2013Newton Hessian J'* J should be avoided, because the matrix is badly conditioned and takes many iterations to invert. Instead, we perform a few iterations of a least-squares solver, lsqr() , to approximately solve J * p = d_pred - d_obs and obtain the update direction p . lsqr , from the Julia IterativeSolvers package, is a conjugate-gradient type algorithm for solving least squares problems and is mathematically equivalent to inverting J' * J , but has better numerical properties (Paige and Saunders, 1982). We implement the Gauss-Newton method as follows: model0.m = m0 # Reset velocity model. fhistory_GN = zeros(Float32,maxiter); using IterativeSolvers # Return data as Julia array Ainv.options.return_array = true d_vec = convert_to_array(d_obs) for j=1:maxiter # Model predicted data. d_pred = Pr * Ainv * Ps' * q # GN update direction. p = lsqr(J, d_pred - d_obs; maxiter=6) fhistory_GN[j] = .5f0 * norm(d_pred - d_vec)^2 # OMIT LINE FROM MANUSCRIPT # update model and box constraints. model0.m = model0.m - reshape(p, model0.n) end","title":"FWI via the Gauss\u2013Newton method"},{"location":"tutorials/judi_leading_edge_tutorial/#conclusions","text":"In this final part of our FWI tutorial series, we demonstrated how to set up basic optimization algorithms for waveform inversion using JUDI.
