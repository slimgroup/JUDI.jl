The focus of the package lies on seismic modeling as well as PDE-constrained optimization such as full-waveform inversion (FWI) and imaging (LS-RTM). Wave equations in JUDI are solved with Devito, a Python domain-specific language for automated finite-difference (FD) computations. JUDI's modeling operators can also be used as layers in (convolutional) neural networks to implement physics-augmented deep learning algorithms. For this, check out JUDI's deep learning extension JUDI4Flux.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorials/01_intro/","page":"Introduction to JUDI","title":"Introduction to JUDI","text":"using JUDI, PyPlot, LinearAlgebra","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorials/01_intro/#Physical-problem-setup","page":"Introduction to JUDI","title":"Physical problem setup","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"tutorials/01_intro/#Grid","page":"Introduction to JUDI","title":"Grid","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"tutorials/01_intro/","page":"Introduction to JUDI","title":"Introduction to JUDI","text":"JUDI relies on a cartesian grid for modeling and inversion.
