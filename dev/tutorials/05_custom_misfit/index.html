We will use one of <a href="https://github.com/slimgroup/JUDI.jl">JUDI</a>&#39;s FWI example as a skeleton and illustrate the losses available in the package and how to input a custom data misfit function.</p><h2 id="Single-source-loss"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Single-source-loss">Single source loss</a><a id="Single-source-loss-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Single-source-loss" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>In <a href="https://github.com/slimgroup/JUDI.jl">JUDI</a>, the data misfit function is defined on a single shot record basis (single source experiment) and will be automatically reduced by julia&#39;s distribution for multiple sources. Therefore, the misfit function is extremly simple and should have the form:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">
function misfit(dsyn, dobs)
    fval = ...
    adjoint_source = ...
    return fval, adjoint_source
end
</code></pre><p>Where <code>fval</code> is the misfit value for a given pair of synthetic <code>dsyn</code> and observed <code>dobs</code> shot records and <code>adjoint_source</code> is the residual to be backpropagated (adjoint wave-equation source) for the computation of the adjoint state gradient. For example the standard <span>$\ell_2$</span> loss (default misfit in JUDI) is defined as</p><pre><code class="language-julia">
function mse(dsyn, dobs)
    fval = .5f0 * norm(dsyn - dobs)^2
    adjoint_source = syn - dobs
    return fval, adjoint_source
end
</code></pre><p>With this convention defined, we will now perform FWI with a few misfit functions and highlight the flexibility of this interface, including the possibility to use Julia&#39;s automatic differentiation frameworks to compute the adjoint souce of misfit functions difficult to differentiate by hand.</p><h1 id="Inversion-setup"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Inversion-setup">Inversion setup</a><a id="Inversion-setup-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Inversion-setup" title="Permalink"></a></h1><pre><code class="language-julia">using SegyIO, HDF5, PythonPlot, JUDI, Random, LinearAlgebra, Printf, SlimPlotting, SlimOptim, Statistics</code></pre><pre><code class="language-julia"># Define some utilities for plotting

We can see that in this case the adjoint source is pointwise normalized (in time and receiver position) which allows to mitigate outlier in the data such as incorrect amplitudes due to geophone mis-functionment. To illustrate this property, wee create an aritifical dataset with outliers to showcase the added robustness by artificially rescaling a few traces picked at random in every shot record of the dataset</p><pre><code class="language-julia">d_outlier = deepcopy(d_obs)

For this example, we will use SlimOptim&#39;s spectral projected gradient, a simple gradient base optimization method were we impose bound constraints on the model. For practical considerations, we will also work with a stochastic objective function that only computes the gradient on a random subset of shots at each iteration. This method has been show to be efficient for seismic inversion in particualr with advanced algorithms with constraints or on simpler illustrative examples such as this one. We will use 8 shots per iteration (50% of the dataset) and run 20 iterations of the algorithm.</p><pre><code class="language-julia">g_const = 0

On the other hand, the standard <code>mse</code> misfits fails to lead to an acceptable inverted velocity in the presence of outliers as these outliers will lead to the main contribution to the gradient. These artifacts, once present in the velocity model after the few first iteration, cannot be recovered from.</p><pre><code class="language-julia">figure(figsize=(14, 7))

As illustrated above, the misfit is a simple keyword argument to the <code>fwi_objective/lsrtm_objective</code> function and consequently, any function returning the misfit value and adjoint source can be provided. In particular, users can take advantage of the extensive automatic differentiation ecosystem in Julia to define complicated misfit functions and automatically derive the corresponding adjoint source. </p><p>In the following, as an illustrative example, we define the misfit for Envelope FWI and let Zygote computes its derivative with respect to the synthetic data. We add a little bit of complexity to the misfit function by normalizing the data by its <span>$\ell_2$</span> norm as well to demonstrate how we can layer complexities in the misfit function and let the automatic differentiation infer the adjoint source.</p><pre><code class="language-julia">using FFTW, Zygote
