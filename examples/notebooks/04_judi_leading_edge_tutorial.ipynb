    "This tutorial is the third part of a full-waveform inversion (FWI) tutorial series with a step-by-step walkthrough of setting up forward and adjoint wave equations and building a basic FWI inversion framework. For discretizing and solving wave equations, we use [Devito], a Python-based domain-specific language for automated generation of finite-difference code (Lange et al., 2016). The first two parts of this tutorial (Louboutin et al., 2017, 2018) demonstrated how to solve the acoustic wave equation for modeling seismic shot records and how to compute the gradient of the FWI objective function using the adjoint-state method. With these two key ingredients, we will now build an inversion framework that can be used to minimize the FWI least-squares objective function.\n",

    "FWI is a computationally and mathematically challenging problem. The computational complexity comes from the fact that an already expensive solution procedure for the wave equation needs to be repeated for a large number of source positions for each iteration of the optimization algorithm. The mathematical complexity comes from the fact that the FWI objective is known to have many local minima due to cycle skipping. "

    "## Optimizing the FWI objective function\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial series is to optimize the FWI objective function with the $\\ell_2$-misfit:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\mathop{\\hbox{minimize}}_{\\mathbf{m}} \\hspace{.2cm} f(\\mathbf{m})= \\sum_{i=1}^{n_s} \\frac{1}{2} \\left\\lVert \\mathbf{d}^\\mathrm{pred}_i (\\mathbf{m}, \\mathbf{q}_i) - \\mathbf{d}_i^\\mathrm{obs} \\right\\rVert_2^2,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{d}^\\mathrm{pred}_i$ and $\\mathbf{d}^\\mathrm{obs}_i$ are the predicted and observed seismic shot records of the $i^{\\text{th}}$ source location and $\\mathbf{m}$ is the velocity model (expressed as squared slowness). In part one, we demonstrated how to implement a forward modeling operator to generate the predicted shot records, which we will denote as $\\mathbf{d}^\\mathrm{pred}_i = \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{m},\\mathbf{q}_i)$. \n",
    "In the second tutorial, we then showed how we can compute the gradient $\\nabla f(\\mathbf{m})$ of the objective function and update our initial model using gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a snag, however. This first-order optimization algorithm has a linear convergence rate at best, and typically requires many iterations to converge. Second-order optimization methods converge considerably faster. To implement them, we first approximate the objective with a second-order Taylor expansion:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\tf(\\mathbf{m}) = f(\\mathbf{m}_0) + \\nabla f(\\mathbf{m}_0) \\delta \\mathbf{m} + \\delta \\mathbf{m}^\\top \\nabla^2 f(\\mathbf{m}_0) \\delta \\mathbf{m} + \\mathcal{O}(\\delta \\mathbf{m}^3),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathcal{O}(\\delta \\mathbf{m}^3)$ represents the error term, $\\nabla f(\\mathbf{m}_0)$ is the gradient as implemented in part two, and $\\nabla^2 f(\\mathbf{m}_0)$ is the Hessian of the objective function, which we will refer to as $\\mathbf{H}$. Rather than using the negative gradient to incrementally update our model, as in gradient descent, we directly calculate a model update $\\delta \\mathbf{m}$ that leads us to the minimum. This is called Newton's method:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\t\\delta \\mathbf{m} = - \\mathbf{H}(\\mathbf{m}_0)^{-1} \\nabla f(\\mathbf{m}_0).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the method converges to the minimum of the FWI objective function quickly, it comes at the cost of having to compute and invert the Hessian matrix (Nocedal and Wright, 2009). Fortunately, for least squares problems, such as FWI, the Hessian can be approximated by the Gauss-Newton (GN) Hessian $\\mathbf{J}^\\top \\mathbf{J}$, where $\\mathbf{J}$ is the Jacobian matrix. This is the partial derivative of the forward modeling operator $\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{m},\\mathbf{q})$ with respect to $\\mathbf{m}$ — something we can easily compute. Furthermore, the Jacobian can also be used to express the gradient of the FWI objective function as $\\nabla f(\\mathbf{m}_0) = \\mathbf{J}^\\top (\\mathbf{d}^\\mathrm{pred}_i - \\mathbf{d}_i^\\mathrm{obs})$, where $\\mathbf{J}^\\top$ is the adjoint (transposed) Jacobian. This is useful, because we now have a set of operators $\\mathbf{F}, \\mathbf{J}$ and $\\mathbf{H}_{GN}=\\mathbf{J}^\\top\\mathbf{J}$, through which we can express both first and second order optimization algorithms for FWI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although forming these matrices explicitly is not possible, since they can become extremely large, we only need the action of these operators on vectors. This allows us to implement these operators matrix-free. In the following section we will demonstrate how to set up these operators in our JUDI software framework and to how to use them to implement FWI algorithms."

    "In the context of seismic inversion, the Jacobian is also called the linearized modeling or demigration operator and its adjoint `J'` is the migration operator. One drawback of this notation is that the forward wavefields for the gradient calculation have to be recomputed, since the forward modeling operator only returns the shot records and not the complete wavefields. For this reason, JUDI has an additional function for computing the gradients of the FWI objective function `f,g = fwi_objective(model0,q[i],d_obs[i])`, which takes the current model, source and data vectors as an input and computes the objective value and gradient in parallel without having to recompute the forward wavefields.\n",

In JUDI, this is accomplished by choosing a random vector of integers between 1 and 16 and indexing the data vectors as described earlier. Furthermore, we will apply a projection operator `proj(x)`, which prevent velocities (or squared slownesses) becoming negative or too large by clipping values outside the allowed range.\n",

In practice, where starting models are typically less accurate than in our example, FWI is often performed from low to high frequencies, since the objective function has less local minima for lower frequencies (Bunks et al., 1995).

Using our matrix-free operator for the Jacobian J, we can modify the above code to implement the Gauss–Newton method (Equation 3) to improve the convergence rate. In practice, directly inverting the Gauss–Newton Hessian `J'* J` should be avoided, because the matrix is badly conditioned and takes many iterations to invert. Instead, we perform a few iterations of a least-squares solver, `lsqr()`, to approximately solve `J * p = d_pred - d_obs` and obtain the update direction `p`. `lsqr`,  from the Julia `IterativeSolvers` package, is a conjugate-gradient type algorithm for solving least squares problems and is mathematically equivalent to inverting `J' * J`, but has better numerical properties (Paige and Saunders, 1982).

    "In contrast to our SGD algorithm, we use all shot records in every iteration, since stochastic methods for second order algorithms are less well understood, making this approach considerably more expensive than our previous algorithm. However, as shown in figures 2 and 3, it achieves a superior result, with a considerably lower misfit compared to the known model. Furthermore, figure 3 shows that it achieves the improved result in relatively few iterations."

    "An alternative to (Gauss–)Newton methods are quasi-Newton methods, which build up an approximation of the Hessian from previous gradients only and require no additional PDE solves or matrix inversions. Implementing an efficient and correct version of this method, such as the L-BFGS algorithm, exceeds a few lines of code and we therefore leave this exercise to the reader. Instead of implementing more complicated algorithms by hand, it is also possible to interface third-party Julia optimization libraries and an example for this is given in the notebook **fwi_example_NLopt.ipynb**.\n",

    "Even though all examples shown here are two-dimensional, in order to make them reproducible on a laptop or desktop PC, JUDI can be used for 3D modeling and inversion without having to change the code, since the number of dimensions are automatically inferred from the velocity model and data dimensions.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this final part of our FWI tutorial series, we demonstrated how to set up basic optimization algorithms for waveform inversion using JUDI. The methods shown here are all gradient based and differ in the way how update directions for the velocity model are computed. Our numerical examples can serve for the reader as a basis for developing more advanced FWI workflows, which usually include additional data preprocessing, frequency continuation techniques or further model constraints.\n",
