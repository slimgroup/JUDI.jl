#' # Create a JUDI model structure
#' In JUDI, a `Model` structure contains the grid information (origin, spacing, number of gridpoints)
#' and the physical parameters. The squared slowness is always required as the base physical parameter for propagation. In addition,
#' JUDI supports additional physical representations. First we accept `density` that can either be a direct input `Model(n, d, o, m, rho)` or
#' an optional keyword argument `Model(n,d,o,m;rho=rho)`. Second, we also provide VTI/TTI kernels parametrized by the THomsen parameters that can be input as keyword arguments
#' `Model(n,d,o,m; rho=rho, epsilon=epsilon;delta=delta,theta=theta,phi=phi)`. Because the thomsen parameters are optional the propagator wil lonloy use the ones provided. 
#' For example `Model(n,d,o,m; rho=rho, epsilon=epsilon;delta=delta)` will infer a VTI propagation

#' ## Create discrete parameters
# Set up model structure
n = (601, 151)   # (x,y,z) or (x,z)
d = (10f0, 10f0)
o = (0., 0.)

# Velocity [km/s]
v = ones(Float32,n) .+ 0.5f0
v0 = ones(Float32,n) .+ 0.51f0
v[:, 101:end] .= 2f0
v0[:, 101:end] .= 2f0

# Slowness squared [s^2/km^2]
m = (1f0 ./ v).^2
m0 = (1f0 ./ v0).^2

# Setup model structure
nsrc = 1	# number of sources
model = Model(n, d, o, m)
model0 = Model(n, d, o, m0)

#' # Create acquisition geometry
#' In this simple usage example, we create a simple acquisiton by hand. In practice the acquisition geometry will be defined by the dataset
#' beeing inverted. We show in a spearate tutorial how to use [SegyIO.jl](https://github.com/slimgroup/SegyIO.jl) to handle SEGY seismic datasets in JUDI.

#' ## Create source and receivers positions at the surface
# Set up receiver geometry
xrec = [1 * (n[1] - 1) * d[1] / 4]
yrec = [0f0] # WE have to set the y coordiante to zero (or any number) for 2D modeling
zrec = [d[1]]

# receiver sampling and recording time
timeD = 2500f0   # receiver recording time [ms]
dtD = 4f0    # receiver sampling interval [ms]

# Set up receiver structure
recGeometry = Geometry(xrec, yrec, zrec; dt=dtD, t=timeD, nsrc=nsrc)

#' The source geometry is a but different. Because we want to create a survey with `nsrc` shot records, we need
#' to convert the vector of sources postions `[s0, s1, ... sn]` into an array of array [[s0], [s1], ...] so that
#' JUDI understands that this is a set of indepednet `nsrc`

xsrc = 3 * (n[1] - 1) * d[1] / 4
ysrc = 0f0
zsrc = d[1]

# Set up source structure
srcGeometry = Geometry(xsrc, ysrc, zsrc; dt=dtD, t=timeD)

#' # Source judiVector
#' Finally, with the geometry defined, we can create a source wavelet (a simple Ricker wavelet here) a our first `judiVector`
#' In JUDI, a `judiVector` is the core structure that represent a acquisition-geometry based dataset. This structure encapsulate
#' the physical locations (trace coordinates) and corrsponding data trace in a source-based structure. for a given `judiVector` `d` then
#' `d[1]` will be the shot record for the first source, or in the case of the source term, the first source wavelet and its positon.

# setup wavelet
f0 = 0.015f0     # kHz
wavelet = ricker_wavelet(timeD, dtD, f0)
q = judiVector(srcGeometry, wavelet)

#' # Modeling
#' With our survey and subsurface model setup, we can now model and image seismic data.
#' Linear Operators
#' The core idea behind JUDI is to abstract seismic inverse problems in term of linear algebra. In its simplest form, seismic inversion can be formulated as
#' ```math
#' \underset{\mathbf{m}}{\text{argmin}} \ \ \phi(\mathbf{m}) = \frac{1}{2} ||\mathbf{P}_r \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{m}) \mathbf{P}_s^{\top} \mathbf{q} - \mathbf{d} ||_2^2 \\
#' \text{   } \\
#' \nabla_{\mathbf{m}} \phi(\mathbf{m}) = \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{m}, \mathbf{q})^{\top} (\mathbf{P}_r \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{m}) \mathbf{P}_s^{\top} \mathbf{q} - \mathbf{d})
#' ```
#' 
#' where $\mathbf{P}_r$ is the receiver projection (measurment operator) and $\mathbf{P}_s^{\top}$ is the source injection operator (adjoint of measurment at the source location).
#' Therefore, we bastracted these operation to be able to define these operators

# Setup operators
F = judiModeling(model, srcGeometry, recGeometry)
F0 = judiModeling(model0, srcGeometry, recGeometry)

#' # Model and image data

#' We first model synthetic data using our defined source and true model 
# Nonlinear modeling
dobs = F*q

#' # Inversion
#' Our main goal is to provide an inversion framework for seismic inversion. In this tutorial, we highlight the different imaging conditions
#' available in JUDI. These imaging conditions are designed to enhanced properties in the gradient beneficial to the inversion problem such
#' as the frequency content. Because these imaging conditions are intended tho be used in potential least-square problems, we also implemented
#' (and test as part of our CI) their adjoint such that we can model linearized data with the JAcobian that correspond to the adjoint of the
#' modified adjoint state crosscorelation imaging condition.

#' We compute now the FWI gradient with three different imaging conditions:
#' - "as" adjoint state imaging condition. This is the conventional cross-correlation adjoint state gradient.
#' - "isic" that computes the inverse scattering imaging condition designed to provide reflections for LSRTM (high frequency content)
#' - "FWI" that computes the complement of "isic" and brings up the low frequency content for velocity inversion
#'
#' These can be specified in the Option structure via `IC="as/isic/fwi`

fas, g_as = fwi_objective(model0, q, 0*dobs; options=Options(IC="as", space_order=12))
fisic, g_isic = fwi_objective(model0, q, 0*dobs; options=Options(IC="isic", space_order=12))
ffwi, g_fwi = fwi_objective(model0, q, 0*dobs; options=Options(IC="fwi", space_order=12))

#' We show below the sensitivity kernels for a single source-receiver pair highlighting the inversion properties of these imaging conditions
